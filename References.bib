@inproceedings{Iturrate2013,
abstract = {One of the main problems of EEG-based brain computer interfaces (BCIs) is their low information rate, thus for complex tasks the user needs large amounts of time to solve the task. In an attempt to reduce this time and improve the application robustness, recent works have explored shared-control strategies where the device does not only execute the decoded commands, but it is also involved in executing the task. This work proposes a shared-control BCI using error potentials for a 2D reaching task with discrete actions and states. The proposed system has several interesting properties: the system is scalable without increasing the complexity of the user's mental task; the interaction is natural for the user, as the mental task is to monitor the device performance to promote its task learning (in this context the reaching task); and the system has the potential to be combined with additional brain signals to recover or learn from interaction errors. Online control experiments were performed with four subjects, showing that it was possible to reach a goal location from any starting point within a 5×5 grid in around 23 actions (about 19 seconds of EEG signal), both with fixed goals and goals freely chosen by the users. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

@inproceedings{Ehrlich2016,
abstract = {Validating appropriateness and naturalness of human-robot interaction (HRI) is commonly performed by taking subjective measures from human interaction partners, e.g. questionnaire ratings. Although these measures can be of high value for robot designers, they are very sensitive and can be inaccurate and/or biased. In this paper we propose and validate a neuro-based method for objectively validating robot behavior in HRI. We propose to detect from the electronencephalo-gram (EEG) of a human interaction partner, the perception of inappropriate / unexpected / erroneous robot behavior. To validate this method, we conducted an EEG experiment with a simplified HRI protocol in which a humanoid robot displayed context-dependent erroneous behavior from time to time. The EEG data taken from 13 participants revealed biologically plausible error-related potentials (ErrP) whose spatio-temporal distributions match well with related neuroscientific research. We further demonstrate that perceived erroneous robot action can reliably be modeled and detected from human EEG signals with classification accuracies on avg. 69.7±9.1{\%}. These findings confirm principal feasibility of the proposed method and suggest that EEG-based ErrP detection can be used for quantitative evaluation and thus improvement of robot behavior.},

Offline reinforcement learning algorithms hold tremendous promise for making it possible to turn large datasets into powerful decision making engines. Effective offline reinforcement learning methods would be able to extract policies with the maximum possible utility out of the available data, thereby allowing automation of a wide range of decision-making domains, from healthcare and education to robotics. However, the limitations of current algorithms make this difficult. We will aim to provide the reader with an understanding of these challenges, particularly in the context of modern deep reinforcement learning methods, and describe some potential solutions that have been explored in recent work to mitigate these challenges, along with recent applications, and a discussion of perspectives on open problems in the field.},

@article{Spuler2012,
abstract = {Objective To investigate whether error-related potentials can be used to increase information transfer rate of a P3 brain–computer interface (BCI) in healthy and motor-impaired individuals. Methods Extraction and classification of the error-related potential was performed offline on data recorded from six amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. An online study with 17 healthy and six motor impaired participants followed, using a modified P3 speller to provide explicit feedback of spelled letters. On recognition of error-related potentials, the interface informed users that the incorrect letter was automatically deleted. Results The offline cross-validation estimate of P3 speller data of six ALS patients increased bit rate by 0.44bit/trial. During online copy spelling, the participants increased their bit rate by 0.52bit/trial with the error correction system (ECS). Some participants performed free spelling and were able to increase their bit rate. Finally, we demonstrated that healthy participants could increase their bit rate by using a classifier pre-trained on other users' data. Conclusions Error-related potentials as a secondary source of information can be used to increase overall bit rate in a P3 BCI. Significance The method should be made available to any patient using the P3 BCI for communication.},

The to-be-attended feature was either varied in a trial-by-trial fashion (transient attention) or was kept constant for an entire experimental block (sustained attention). Both transient and sustained attention resulted in a larger negativity for attended as compared to unattended stimuli between 200 and 300 ms post-stimulus. This effect was more pronounced for sustained attention than for transient attention and larger for attention to color than for attention directed to stimulus form. In the sustained, but not in the transient attention condition, color attention resulted in larger positivities for attended stimuli between 150 and 200 ms and in the P3 time range. These effects are interpreted as evidence for the existence of non-spatial attentional selection processes that are more effective under sustained than under transient attention conditions and are different from processes of visual-spatial attention. Moreover, the results indicate a special status for sustained attention to stimulus color."

@article{Nguyen2020,
abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been around for decades and employed to solve various sequential decision-making problems. These algorithms however have faced great challenges when dealing with high-dimensional environments. The recent development of deep learning has enabled RL methods to drive optimal policies for sophisticated and capable agents, which can perform efficiently in these challenging environments. This paper addresses an important aspect of deep RL related to situations that require multiple agents to communicate and cooperate to solve complex tasks. A survey of different approaches to problems related to multi-agent deep RL (MADRL) is presented, including non-stationarity, partial observability, continuous state and action spaces, multi-agent training schemes, multi-agent transfer learning. The merits and demerits of the reviewed methods will be analyzed and discussed, with their corresponding applications explored. It is envisaged that this review provides insights about various MADRL methods and can lead to future development of more robust and highly useful multi-agent learning methods for solving real-world problems.},

abstract = {Motor imagery (MI) training can improve motor performance which is widely used in sport training. BCI based on MI can demonstrate the quality of mental efforts via neurofeedback based on sensorimotor activation. Despite numerous studies of MI in context of classical sport, there are no studies aimed at improvement for e-athletes performance. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of MI-training on reaction time and velocity in gaming mouse control tasks. The study involved 14 healthy naive volunteers, divided into two subgroups. Experimental subgroup (N = 8) was trained with kinesthetic MI with BCI-visual feedback. The control subgroup (N = 6) had no BCI-feedback. In the speed selection task participants had to click on the correct mouse button. In the fast-clicking task participants should click as fast as they can for one minute. Each task was before (pretest) and after (posttest) MI training. During the training participants imagined finger movements used in actual task executions. During the task executions reaction time was recorded and EEG was recorded during MI training. Performed statistical analysis on a group level included paired comparisons between pretest and posttest (Wilcoxon signed-rank tests). Statistically significant changes (p {\textless} 0.05) in the reaction time in speed selection task and reaction velocity in fast clicking task after MI-training in experimental subgroup. Everyone in experimental subgroup had stable ERD during motor imagery, while there were neither differences in reaction time nor in reaction velocity in control group. The obtained results confirm the previously shown effects of motor imagery on sensorimotor performance.},

abstract = {Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are specialized systems that allow users to control computer applications using their brain waves. With the advent of consumer-grade electroencephalography (EEG) devices, brain-controlled systems started to find applications outside of the medical field, opening many research opportunities in the area of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). One particular area that is gaining more evidence due to the arrival of consumer-grade devices is that of computer games, as it allows more user-friendly applications of BCI technology for the general public. In this paper, the results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of BCI games using consumer-grade devices are presented. Papers published in a time span of 12 years were reviewed and their data collected using a rigid systematic process. Several analyses were made based on the gathered data, and a clear view of the current scenario and challenges for HCI of BCI-based games using consumer-grade devices is provided. The search shows that although many games were created with simplified controls for research purposes, there was an increasing number of more user-friendly BCI games, especially for entertainment. The most predominant control signals were the attention and meditation, followed by motor imagery and emotion recognition, being mainly captured by NeuroSky and Emotiv EEG devices. The results also show that there are still many open issues and research opportunities in the field of HCI for BCI-based games, as most evaluations investigated only quantitative aspects of the BCI systems, while very few studies analyzed usability and qualitative aspects of the users' interaction with the games.},

However, there is one noticeable problem about them; in most cases, their developers most often do not take into consideration people with disabilities when they are creating video game applications. People with disabilities are thus partially or completely excluded from their use. Prior to any additional work, it is required to have an updated state of the art about this topic. This paper shows the results of a systematic literature review conducted to define the current status of video games accessibility. The type of review is broader than usual, so it is a systematic mapping study (a specific class of systematic review). Besides elaborating the state of the art (qualitative information), we identified and analyzed related works (45 relevant studies) to provide quantitative information of the performed search (including graphs and tables), such as the number of articles found by phases, their sources, their research type, the research questions answered, the kind of disability addressed, and the type and year of publications. None of the studied initiatives can guarantee universally accessible video game applications. Our proposal is to create an integral software engineering methodology that considers accessibility guidelines, techniques, strategies, human factors, etc. in the video game software development process.},

In this article, we study the problem of training intelligent agents in service of game development. Unlike the agents built to 'beat the game,' our agents aim to produce human-like behavior to help with game evaluation and balancing. We discuss two fundamental metrics based on which we measure the human-likeness of agents, namely skill and style, which are multifaceted concepts with practical implications outlined in this article. We report four case studies in which the style and skill requirements inform the choice of algorithms and metrics used to train agents; ranging from A∗ search to state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (RL). Furthermore, we, show that the learning potential of state-of-the-art deep RL models does not seamlessly transfer from the benchmark environments to target ones without heavily tuning their hyperparameters, leading to linear scaling of the engineering efforts, and computational cost with the number of target domains.},

abstract = {Providing Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents with human feedback can dramatically improve various aspects of learn- ing. However, previous methods require human observer to give inputs explicitly (e.g., press buttons, voice interface), burdening the human in the loop of RL agent's learning pro- cess. Further, it is sometimes difficult or impossible to obtain the explicit human advise (feedback), e.g., autonomous driv- ing, disabled rehabilitation, etc. In this work, starting from game playing, we investigate capturing human's intrinsic re- actions as implicit (and natural) feedback through EEG in the form of error-related potentials (ErrP), providing a natural and direct way for humans to improve the RL agent learn- ing in various visual-based games. As such, the human intel- ligence can be integrated via implicit feedback with RL al- gorithms to accelerate the learning of RL agent. We develop three reasonably complex 2D discrete navigational games to experimentally evaluate the overall performance of the pro- posed work. Major contributions of our work are as follows, (i) we propose and experimentally validate the zero-shot learning of ErrPs, where the ErrPs can be learned for one game, and transferred to other unseen games, (ii) we pro- pose a novel RL framework for integrating implicit human feedbacks via ErrPs with RL models, improving the label ef- ficiency and reducing human cognitive load, and (iii) com- pared to prior works, we scale the application of ErrPs to rea- sonably complex environments, and demonstrate the signif- icance of our approach for accelerated learning through real user experiments.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) from human preferences suffered from temporal and interaction environments' limitations, which rule out real-time and real-world robotic applications of deep RL. To overcome the limitations, this study introduced the electroencephalography (EEG)-measured error-related potentials (ErrPs) to train a robotic RL system based on a brain-computer interface (BCI). We decoded ErrP signals by selecting human preferences in real-time to train robotic behavior by deep RL during a binary object selection task. Twelve healthy subjects participated in the ErrP experiments, in which they were asked to select and adjust self-favored behavior after a machine's random selections. The decoded ErrP signals classified by a convolutional neural network (CNN)architecture to achieve an average classification accuracy and an area under the ROC curve of 67.49{\%} and 0.639, respectively. By using the well-trained ErrP signals classifier to train the deep RL system, our final results for training robotic behavior through ErrP-based preferences showed an average of 15.21{\%} improvement in efficiency while obtaining acceptable rewards in RL. Thus, the work used brain signals instead of pressing or clicking buttons as the rewards of RL, and constructed a real-time and free from interaction interference intuitive RL system.},

abstract = {Objective. Error-related potentials (ErrP) are generated in the brain when humans perceive errors. These ErrP signals can be used to classify actions as erroneous or non-erroneous, using single-trial electroencephalography (EEG). A small number of studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using ErrP detection as feedback for reinforcement-learning-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI), confirming the possibility of developing more autonomous BCI. These systems could be made more efficient with specific information about the type of error that occurred. A few studies differentiated the ErrP of different errors from each other, based on direction or severity. However, errors cannot always be categorised in these ways. We aimed to investigate the feasibility of differentiating very similar error conditions from each other, in the absence of previously explored metrics. Approach. In this study, we used two data sets with 25 and 14 participants to investigate the differences between errors. The two error conditions in each task were similar in terms of severity, direction and visual processing. The only notable differences between them were the varying cognitive processes involved in perceiving the errors, and differing contexts in which the errors occurred. We used a linear classifier with a small feature set to differentiate the errors on a single-trial basis. Main results. For both data sets, we observed neurophysiological distinctions between the ErrPs related to each error type. We found further distinctions between age groups. Furthermore, we achieved statistically significant single-trial classification rates for most participants included in the classification phase, with mean overall accuracy of 65.2{\%} and 65.6{\%} for the two tasks. Significance. As a proof of concept our results showed that it is feasible, using single-trial EEG, to classify these similar error types against each other. This study paves the way for more detailed and efficient learning in BCI, and thus for a more autonomous human-machine interaction.},

abstract = {Electroencephalography based brain computer interface has enabled communication of human's intention to a computer directly from the brain by decoding signatures that relay the intention information. Error-related potential has been adopted as a signature for natural communication and performance monitoring, among others. In this work, we investigate the use of error-related potential as an input channel to transfer human preference of a strategical advisory to a computer. Air traffic control task was used as a case study to make an empirical inquiry of error-related potential for higher level cognitive tasks (i.e. situation awareness in air traffic control tasks). The experimental task requires the subjects to monitor and assess air traffic scenarios presented on a simulated environment that provides conflict resolution advisories. The task is known to be highly mental demanding as it requires continuous situation awareness of the traffic. An interface and experimental protocol were developed for this experiment to validate that error-related potential can be used a new channel for preference. The implementation of the complete design was described together with the experimental evidence of error-related potential. According to the results, we found error-related potential that is in line with existing literature. We also discussed how the preliminary findings of this work can be used as an integral part of an intelligent conflict resolution advisory system that can learn from human preference and duplicate the decision making.},

abstract = {This article introduces the Turn-Taking Spiking Neural Network (TTSNet), which is a cognitive model to perform early turn-taking prediction about a human or agent's intentions. The TTSNet framework relies on implicit and explicit multimodal communication cues (physical, neurological and physiological) to be able to predict when the turn-taking event will occur in a robust and unambiguous fashion. To test the theories proposed, the TTSNet framework was implemented on an assistant robotic nurse, which predicts surgeon's turn-taking intentions and delivers surgical instruments accordingly. Experiments were conducted to evaluate TTSNet's performance in early turn-taking prediction. It was found to reach an (Formula presented.) score of 0.683 given 10{\%} of completed action, and an (Formula presented.) score of 0.852 at 50{\%} and 0.894 at 100{\%} of the completed action. This performance outperformed multiple state-of-the-art algorithms, and surpassed human performance when limited partial observation is given ({\textless}40{\%}). Such early turn-taking prediction capability would allow robots to perform collaborative actions proactively, in order to facilitate collaboration and increase team efficiency.},

abstract = {Error-related potentials (ErrP) have been increasingly studied in psychophysical experiments as well as for brain-machine interfacing. In the latter case, the generalisation capabilities of ErrP decoders is a crucial element to avoid frequent recalibration processes, thus increasing their usability. Previous studies have suggested that ErrP signals are rather stable across recording sessions. Also, studies using protocols of serial stimuli presentation show that these potentials do not change significantly with the presentation rate. Here we complement these studies by analysing the decoding generalisation capabilities. Using data from monitoring experiments, we evaluate how much the performance degrades when tested in a condition different than the one the decoder was trained with. Moreover, we compare different spatial filtering techniques to see which preprocessing steps yield less-sensitive features for ErrP decoding.},

@article{Yousefi2019,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The ultimate goal of many brain-computer interface (BCI) research efforts is to provide individuals with severe motor impairments with a communication channel that they can control at will. To achieve this goal, an important system requirement is asynchronous control, whereby users can initiate intentional brain activation in a self-paced rather than system-cued manner. However, to date, asynchronous BCIs have been explored in a minority of BCI studies and their performance is generally below that of system-paced alternatives. In this paper, we present an asynchronous electroencephalography (EEG) BCI that detects a non-motor imagery cognitive task and investigated the possibility of improving its performance using error-related potentials (ErrP). APPROACH: Ten able-bodied adults attended two sessions of data collection each, one for training and one for testing the BCI. The visual interface consisted of a centrally located cartoon icon. For each participant, an asynchronous BCI differentiated among the idle state and a personally selected cognitive task (mental arithmetic, word generation or figure rotation). The BCI continuously analyzed the EEG data stream and displayed real-time feedback (i.e. icon fell over) upon detection of brain activity indicative of a cognitive task. The BCI also monitored the EEG signals for the presence of error-related potentials following the presentation of feedback. An ErrP classifier was invoked to automatically alter the task classifier outcome when an error-related potential was detected. MAIN RESULTS: The average post-error correction trial success rate across participants, 85{\%} [Formula: see text] 12{\%}, was significantly higher (p   {\textless}  0.05) than that pre-error correction (78{\%} [Formula: see text] 11{\%}). SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings support the addition of ErrP-correction to maximize the performance of asynchronous BCIs..},

@article{Kim2017,
abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) enables robots to learn its optimal behavioral strategy in dynamic environments based on feedback. Explicit human feedback during robot RL is advantageous, since an explicit reward function can be easily adapted. However, it is very demanding and tiresome for a human to continuously and explicitly generate feedback. Therefore, the development of implicit approaches is of high relevance. In this paper, we used an error-related potential (ErrP), an event-related activity in the human electroencephalogram (EEG), as an intrinsically generated implicit feedback (rewards) for RL. Initially we validated our approach with seven subjects in a simulated robot learning scenario. ErrPs were detected online in single trial with a balanced accuracy (bACC) of 91{\%}, which was sufficient to learn to recognize gestures and the correct mapping between human gestures and robot actions in parallel. Finally, we validated our approach in a real robot scenario, in which seven subjects freely chose gestures and the real robot correctly learned the mapping between gestures and actions (ErrP detection (90{\%} bACC)). In this paper, we demonstrated that intrinsically generated EEG-based human feedback in RL can successfully be used to implicitly improve gesture-based robot control during human-robot interaction. We call our approach intrinsic interactive RL.},

@article{Bauer2015,
abstract = {Restorative brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are increasingly used to provide feedback of neuronal states in a bid to normalize pathological brain activity and achieve behavioral gains. However, patients and healthy subjects alike often show a large variability, or even inability, of brain self-regulation for BCI control, known as BCI illiteracy. Although current co-adaptive algorithms are powerful for assistive BCIs, their inherent class switching clashes with the operant conditioning goal of restorative BCIs. Moreover, due to the treatment rationale, the classifier of restorative BCIs usually has a constrained feature space, thus limiting the possibility of classifier adaptation. In this context, we applied a Bayesian model of neurofeedback and reinforcement learning for different threshold selection strategies to study the impact of threshold adaptation of a linear classifier on optimizing restorative BCIs. For each feedback iteration, we first determined the thresholds that result in minimal action entropy and maximal instructional efficiency. We then used the resulting vector for the simulation of continuous threshold adaptation. We could thus show that threshold adaptation can improve reinforcement learning, particularly in cases of BCI illiteracy. Finally, on the basis of information-theory, we provided an explanation for the achieved benefits of adaptive threshold setting.},

@incollection{Rubin2012,
abstract = {Interactions between an organism and its environment are commonly treated in the framework of Markov Decision Processes (MDP). While standard MDP is aimed solely at maximizing expected future rewards (value), the circular flow of information between the agent and its environment is generally ignored. In particular, the information gained from the environment by means of perception and the information involved in the process of action selection (i.e., control) are not treated in the standard MDP setting. In this paper, we focus on the control information and show how it can be combined with the reward measure in a unified way. Both of these measures satisfy the familiar Bellman recursive equations, and their linear combination (the free-energy) provides an interesting new optimization criterion. The tradeoff between value and information, explored using our INFO-RL algorithm, provides a principled justification for stochastic (soft) policies. We use computational learning theory to show that these optimal policies are also robust to uncertainties in settings with only partial knowledge of the MDP parameters. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

@article{Lotte2018,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE Most current electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are based on machine learning algorithms. There is a large diversity of classifier types that are used in this field, as described in our 2007 review paper. Now, approximately ten years after this review publication, many new algorithms have been developed and tested to classify EEG signals in BCIs. The time is therefore ripe for an updated review of EEG classification algorithms for BCIs. APPROACH We surveyed the BCI and machine learning literature from 2007 to 2017 to identify the new classification approaches that have been investigated to design BCIs. We synthesize these studies in order to present such algorithms, to report how they were used for BCIs, what were the outcomes, and to identify their pros and cons. MAIN RESULTS We found that the recently designed classification algorithms for EEG-based BCIs can be divided into four main categories: adaptive classifiers, matrix and tensor classifiers, transfer learning and deep learning, plus a few other miscellaneous classifiers. Among these, adaptive classifiers were demonstrated to be generally superior to static ones, even with unsupervised adaptation. Transfer learning can also prove useful although the benefits of transfer learning remain unpredictable. Riemannian geometry-based methods have reached state-of-the-art performances on multiple BCI problems and deserve to be explored more thoroughly, along with tensor-based methods. Shrinkage linear discriminant analysis and random forests also appear particularly useful for small training samples settings. On the other hand, deep learning methods have not yet shown convincing improvement over state-of-the-art BCI methods. SIGNIFICANCE This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the modern classification algorithms used in EEG-based BCIs, presents the principles of these methods and guidelines on when and how to use them. It also identifies a number of challenges to further advance EEG classification in BCI.},

In this context, electrophysiological measures of error detection, directly measured from a person's brain activity as Error-related Potentials (ErrPs), can be exploited to provide passive adaptation of an external semi-autonomous system to the human. This concept was implemented in an online robot learning task, where user's evaluation of the robot's actions, in terms of detected ErrP, was exploited to update a reward function in a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. Results from both simulated and experimental studies show that the introduction of human evaluation in the robot learning loop allows for: (1) the acceleration of optimal policy learning in a target reaching task, (2) the introduction of a further degree of control in robot learning, namely identification of one among multiple targets, according to the user's will. Overall, presented results support the potential of human-robot co-adaptive and co-operative strategies to develop human-centered assistive technologies.},

@article{Holroyd2009,
abstract = {A recent theory holds that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) uses reinforcement learning signals conveyed by the midbrain dopamine system to facilitate flexible action selection. According to this position, the impact of reward prediction error signals on ACC modulates the amplitude of a component of the event-related brain potential called the error-related negativity (ERN). The theory predicts that ERN amplitude is monotonically related to the expectedness of the event: It is larger for unexpected outcomes than for expected outcomes. However, a recent failure to confirm this prediction has called the theory into question. In the present article, we investigated this discrepancy in three trial-and-error learning experiments. All three experiments provided support for the theory, but the effect sizes were largest when an optimal response strategy could actually be learned. This observation suggests that ACC utilizes dopamine reward prediction error signals for adaptive decision making when the optimal behavior is, in fact, learnable. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

@article{Chavarriaga2014,
abstract = {The ability to recognize errors is crucial for efficient behavior. Numerous studies have identified electrophysiological correlates of error recognition in the human brain (error-related potentials, ErrPs). Consequently, it has been proposed to use these signals to improve human-computer interaction (HCI) or brain-machine interfacing (BMI). Here, we present a review of over a decade of developments toward this goal. This body of work provides consistent evidence that ErrPs can be successfully detected on a single-trial basis, and that they can be effectively used in both HCI and BMI applications. We first describe the ErrP phenomenon and follow up with an analysis of different strategies to increase the robustness of a system by incorporating single-trial ErrP recognition, either by correcting the machine's actions or by providing means for its error-based adaptation. These approaches can be applied both when the user employs traditional HCI input devices or in combination with another BMI channel. Finally, we discuss the current challenges that have to be overcome in order to fully integrate ErrPs into practical applications. This includes, in particular, the characterization of such signals during real(istic) applications, as well as the possibility of extracting richer information from them, going beyond the time-locked decoding that dominates current approaches. {\textcopyright} 2014 Chavarriaga, Sobolewski and Mill{\'{a}}n.},

Since the proposal of neural-based implementations for the reinforcement learning paradigm (which reduced learning time and memory requirements to realistic values) reinforcement functions have become the critical components. Using a particular definition for reinforcement functions (RF), we solve, for a specific case, the so-called exploration versus exploitation dilemma through the careful computation of the RF parameter values. The proposed algorithm computes, during the exploration part of the learning phase, an estimate for the parameter values. Experiments with the mobile robot Nomad 200 validate our proposals.},

Recently, AlphaGo became the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in AlphaGo evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo's own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo's games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100-0 against the previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo.},

@article{CURSOR-CONTROL-PAPER,
abstract = {The effectiveness of today's human–machine interaction is limited by a communication bottleneck as operators are required to translate high-level concepts into a machine-mandated sequence of instructions. In contrast, we demonstrate effective, goal-oriented control of a computer system without any form of explicit communication from the human operator. Instead, the system generated the necessary input itself, based on real-time analysis of brain activity. Specific brain responseswere evoked by violating the operators' expectations to varying degrees. The evoked brain activity demonstrated detectable differences reflecting congruency with or deviations from the operators' expectations. Real-time analysis of this activity was used to build a user model of those expectations, thus representing the optimal (expected) state as perceived by the operator. Based on this model, which was continuously updated, the computer automatically adapted itself to the expectations of its operator. Further analyses showed this evoked activity to originate from themedial prefrontal cortex and to exhibit a linear correspondence to the degree of expectation violation. These findings extend our un- derstanding of human predictive coding and provide evidence that the information used to generate the user model is task-specific and reflects goal congruency. This paper demonstrates a form of interaction without any explicit input by the operator, enabling computer systems to become neuroadaptive, that is, to automatically adapt to specific aspects of their operator'smindset.Neuroadaptive technology significantlywidens the communication bottleneck and has the potential to fundamentally change the way we interact with technology.},

@inproceedings{ROBOT-CONTROL-PAPER,
abstract = {Reinforcement learning algorithms have been successfully applied in robotics to learn how to solve tasks based on reward signals obtained during task execution. These reward signals are usually modeled by the programmer or provided by supervision. However, there are situations in which this reward is hard to encode, and so would require a supervised approach of reinforcement learning, where a user directly types the reward on each trial. This paper proposes to use brain activity recorded by an EEG-based BCI system as reward signals. The idea is to obtain the reward from the activity generated while observing the robot solving the task. This process does not require an explicit model of the reward signal. Moreover, it is possible to capture subjective aspects which are specific to each user. To achieve this, we designed a new protocol to use brain activity related to the correct or wrong execution of the task. We showed that it is possible to detect and classify different levels of error in single trials. We also showed that it is possible to apply reinforcement learning algorithms to learn new similar tasks using the rewards obtained from brain activity. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measure the weak electromagnetic signals generated by neuronal activity in the brain. Using these signals to characterize and locate neural activation in the brain is a challenge that requires expertise in physics, signal processing, statistics, and numerical methods. As part of the MNE software suite, MNE-Python is an open-source software package that addresses this challenge by providing state-of-the-art algorithms implemented in Python that cover multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. Moreover, MNE-Python is tightly integrated with the core Python libraries for scientific comptutation (NumPy, SciPy) and visualization (matplotlib and Mayavi), as well as the greater neuroimaging ecosystem in Python via the Nibabel package. The code is provided under the new BSD license allowing code reuse, even in commercial products. Although MNE-Python has only been under heavy development for a couple of years, it has rapidly evolved with expanded analysis capabilities and pedagogical tutorials because multiple labs have collaborated during code development to help share best practices. MNE-Python also gives easy access to preprocessed datasets, helping users to get started quickly and facilitating reproducibility of methods by other researchers. Full documentation, including dozens of examples, is available at http://martinos.org/mne.},
